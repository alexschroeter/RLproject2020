# TODO: Use better file access
# TODO: Use Dataclasses?
# TODO: exit initial window properly on x

# Finalize:

# Potential future features
# TODO  Does Inverse y-Wind feel better?
# TODO  Dyna-Q+? (Which way? Book Ex 8.4 + footnote?) Also Nondeterministic Env?
# TODO: Implement Double Learning: Default 2 tables, if double on: choose 50/50, if off: 100/0. How to deal with expected?
# TODO: Implement Statevalue-Based TD
