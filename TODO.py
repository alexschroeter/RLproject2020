# TODO: Entry for some reward number, mousewheel-click on some tile applies that number as arrival reward for that tile
# TODO: Flag: "Decay Epsilon Episode-wise"
# TODO: Plot all parameters vs timestep -> Give the paramframes names as identifier, then put them into a dict with key equal to name, makes  plotting of params in the end easier

# TODO: (Stochastic) Windy Gridworld (from x & y)
#   TODO -> Action (0,0) as possible action? Show actionvalues in the middle (where greedy policy is now) and greedy policy in some edge
# TODO: Teleporters
# TODO: Ice Floor (can be toggled) -> Hard to solve for human, but no extra challenge for RL Agent!
#   TODO -> Disable Wind if Ice
# TODO: initial actionvalue mean and sigma in gui
# TODO: Set agent params by algorithm keyword
# TODO: Plot Return vs Timestep for non-episodic Tasks
# TODO: Allow running n Agents one after another with fixed params and without visualization to make average plots
#   TODO -> Nice once {timestep: map} is implemented
